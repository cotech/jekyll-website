  <h2>How we can help</h2>

  <p>Domains.coop have announced
    <a href="https://domains.coop/support/">the termination</a> of all
    Domains.coop email and hosting services.</p>

  <p>Co-operative Technologists (CoTech) represents technology
    cooperatives across the UK. It has 46 coops in membership.</p>

  <p>Domain name registrations can remain with Domains.coop, or if
    clients wish, the CoTech members can transfer them to their
    own <code>.coop</code> reseller accounts in order that clients only
    have one organisation to invoice for all their services.</p>

  <p>Four CoTech members are able to offer fast provisioning of email
    and hosting to Domains.coop clients.</p>

  <p>They are, in alphabetical order:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><a href="/co-op/greennet">GreenNet</a></li>
    <li><a href="/co-op/mediablaze-hosts">MediaBlaze Hosts</a></li>
    <li><a href="/co-op/netuxo">Netuxo</a></li>
    <li><a href="/co-op/webarchitects">Webarchitects</a></li>
  </ol>

  <p>All are experienced tech businesses who not only will be able to provide a wide range of other services such as web design. What’s more, they understand cooperatives: because they are cooperatives.</p>
