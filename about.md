*Co-operative Technologists (CoTech) is a growing network of tech and digital service co-operatives working to reshape the technology sector in the UK.* Our members are co-operatives that operate democratically, giving workers (and, in some cases, customers) control over the business. CoTech was founded at Wortley Hall in 2016 and became the first sector specific arm of the [worker.coop federation](https://www.workers.coop/) in September 2024.

*We believe that businesses owned and run by their workers can create better workplaces, deliver higher quality products, and provide greater value to customers.* Unlike traditional businesses, we have no private shareholders extracting profits. Our aim is to change both our industry and society through cooperation. We strive to be a model of thought leadership and innovation in the progressive business movement.

*At CoTech we openly share skills, knowledge, and resources to facilitate community, mutual support, and shared growth in our sector.*

Our activities include:

* hosting in-person and online gatherings
* engaging on the community forum
* seconding employees to each other to meet specific needs
* working on projects together

*Governance of the CoTech network is a collaborative process.* We make decisions by consensus using tools like [Loomio](https://www.loomio.com/cotech/), our [wiki](jttps://wiki.coops.tech/), and [community forum](https://community.coops.tech/). All members are encouraged to participate and help shape our direction as we grow.

## Our Manifesto

We believe in a fairer world in which wealth and resources are distributed to the people who need them rather than those best able to take them.

As [Co-operative Technologists][] we aim to ensure that technology plays its part in creating a fairer world.

Our individual worker co-operatives have shown that workers who collectively own their companies and control their destinies make better workplaces, better suppliers and better digital products.

We call upon tech workers who share our vision to [join us][join].

We call upon consumers of digital products -- including trades unions, charities, governments and private companies -- to reject the false assumption that only multinational conglomerates or private equity-funded startups can be great tech companies. Technology is the lifeblood of all our futures, not just a gravy train for the fortunate few.

We hereby give notice to technology companies that do not treat their employees fairly, do not give their workers control of their businesses and do not seek to create a fairer world that your days are numbered. We are more creative, more committed and more resilient. [Join us][join].
