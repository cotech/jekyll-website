Co-operative Technologists (CoTech) is a growing network of tech and digital service co-operatives working to reshape the technology sector in the UK. Our members are co-operatives that operate democratically, giving workers (and, in some cases, customers) control over the business. CoTech was founded at Wortley Hall in 2016 and became the first sector specific arm of the Worker Coop Federation in July 2024.

We believe that businesses owned and run by their workers can create better workplaces, deliver higher quality products, and provide greater value to customers. Unlike traditional businesses, we have no private shareholders extracting profits. Our aim is to change both our industry and society through cooperation. We strive to be a model of thought leadership and innovation in the progressive business movement.

At CoTech we openly share skills, knowledge, and resources to facilitate community, mutual support, and shared growth in our sector. Our activities include:

* hosting in-person and online gatherings
* engaging on the community forum
* seconding employees to each other to meet specific needs
* working on projects together

Governance of the CoTech network is a collaborative process. We make decisions by consensus using tools like [Loomio](https://www.loomio.com/d/IwREmaVl/co-operative-technologists-community), our [wiki](jttps://wiki.coops.tech/), and [community forum](https://community.coops.tech/). All members are encouraged to participate and help shape our direction as we grow.

The network was founded at <a href="https://wiki.coops.tech/wiki/Main_Page#Wortley_Hall_2016">an event on 14th November 2016</a> at [Wortley Hall -- the worker's stately home][wortley-hall] -- where many of us met for the very first time to share ideas, skills and plans for world domination.
