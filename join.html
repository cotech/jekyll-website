    <h2>For existing tech co-ops</h2>

    <p>If you’re a worker-owned co-operative providing digital or technical services in the UK, we’d love you to join CoTech.</p>

    <p>Our membership is via the workers.coop federation. It costs 0.1% of your labour costs from the last financial year (min. £150 + VAT). You get all workers.coop benefits plus CoTech’s sector-specific ones.</p>
