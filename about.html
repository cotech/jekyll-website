    <h1>About CoTech</h1>

    <p class="large">Co-operative Technologists (CoTech) is a growing network of tech and digital service co-operatives working to reshape the technology sector in the UK.</p>

    <p>Our members are worker-owned  and operate democratically, giving workers (and, in some cases, customers) control and ownership over the business. CoTech was founded at Wortley Hall in 2016 and became the first sector specific arm of the worker.coop federation in September 2024.</p>

    <p>We believe that businesses owned and run by their workers can create better workplaces, deliver higher quality products, and provide greater value to customers. Unlike traditional businesses, we have no private shareholders extracting profits.</p>
