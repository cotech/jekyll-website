    <h1>Why co-ops?</h1>

    <p class="large">Co-operatives are businesses in many sectors and
    in many sizes, but with one crucial difference: they are owned and
    democratically controlled by their members. That means people in
    the business, not external shareholders, set the direction and
    share the value.</p>

    <p>CoTech coops are worker-owned co-operatives, meaning that the members are the workers. So the people delivering the projects co-own and control the business together.</p>
