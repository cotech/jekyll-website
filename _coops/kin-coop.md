Communities have pooled money together for thousands of years. Now you can do it online. 
Kin.coop is a not-for-profit platform and network of financial mutual aid groups.
Build wealth, build community. Pool money with the people you trust. Join Kin.
We allow members to set up as many mutual aid groups as they like, we act as a fiscal host to those groups, allowing them to contribute funds to those groups and request withdrawals when they need.
