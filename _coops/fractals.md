Fractals are a worker’s co-op trying to transform the present to build a different future. We’re building a future where:

**Vulnerable, honest, and caring relationships are the norm** in every part of our lives, so people feel safe, are able to meet their needs and desires

**Power is wielded carefully, consensually, and collaboratively**, so people are able to dismantle systems of oppression, advocate for themselves, and take decisive actions

**Work is focused on creative, meaningful collaboration** that supports people’s flourishing and that helps to meet our collective needs as a society

We do this in a variety of disciplines and domains, like research and evaluation, UX and service design, and anti-oppressive facilitation.
