Fractals are a worker’s co-op trying to transform the present to build a different future. We’re building a future where:

- Vulnerable, honest, and caring relationships are the norm in every part of our lives, so people feel safe, are able to meet their needs and desires
- Power is wielded carefully, consensually, and collaboratively, so people are able to dismantle systems of oppression, advocate for themselves, and take decisive actions
- Work is focused on creative, meaningful collaboration that supports people’s flourishing and that helps to meet our collective needs as a society

We do this in a variety of disciplines and domains, like research and evaluation, UX and service design, and anti-oppressive facilitation.
