We Are Open Co-op creates tailored strategies, communities, and education for clients worldwide. We can start you on a path to opening up your organizational processes, building and working with communities at a global scale or implementing open practices for specific projects. We work to spread the culture, processes and benefits of open wherever we can.

## We are nimble thinkers.

Our acrobatic thought processes are curious, bold, experimental. We improvise a lot, but are disciplined in that improvisation.

## We are connected.

We play with the new and shiny tools, but we pick up the right tool for the job. We are so inclusive that we’re eclectic.

## We are a collective.

Our solidarity gives us power. We believe in surplus, not profit and work as a collective, not as individuals.

## We are professional.

We are constantly learning and take a considered approach to everything we do. We strive to illuminate along the way, giving our clients a competitive edge in the world of social good.

## We are participants.

We invite collaboration and aim to be co-operative despite challenges that come up along the way. We share wildly to invite brilliant people to share their ideas and feedback on the work we’re doing.
