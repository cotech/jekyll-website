We are Very Evil Demons, a worker-owned game development studio based in Dundee, Scotland.

Very Evil Demonsâ€™ primary aim is to acquire contracts for product development, product codevelopment, rapid prototyping, video game console porting, and game development consultancy.

We are a team of five developers - four programmers, and one artist, with experience ranging from single I indie to triple A game development.

We believe in the beauty of human creativity; we do not use generative AI in any of our projects.
