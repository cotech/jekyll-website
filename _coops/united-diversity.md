Together We Have Everything

Imagine if everyone shared some of everything they have: time, money, tools, knowledge, land, food, shelter.

Together, we already have the knowledge, expertise, land, property and resources necessary to empower people, build community, develop co-ops and create commons. We just need to self-organise and start sharing.
