Common Knowledge is a not-for-profit worker cooperative that designs and builds digital tools for grassroots activists.

We share a vision of a world where people are confident in their capacity to self-organise, empowered by digital technology.

We are a cross-disciplinary team that knows how to work together effectively. Our combined expertise includes political organising, strategy, user research, project management, digital product design, graphic design and software engineering.

We place a strong focus on building trust and shared understanding with the activists we work with. We listen to their needs, work out we could augment their organisational capacity and co-design tools in direct collaboration with them.
