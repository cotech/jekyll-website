We are a group of independent developers, specialized in Open Source platforms as Magento, Joomla and WordPress working from our studio in London.

Our projects are united by a common underlying idea. Everything we do aims to empower people and enable them on the path to realizing their projects.

Part of the income from our agency work goes to create links with the community and develop social projects. So far we have engaged with projects in South America, and more recently European and UK-based projects. This is our philosophy.
