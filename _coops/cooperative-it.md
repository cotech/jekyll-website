Cooperative IT is a workers' cooperative, set up to provide IT services.

Our approach is to work with people to help them with their IT needs, finding solutions that fit their organisation and their budgets.

We have experience of looking after large multinational banking systems, small voluntary and community organisations, and everything in between.

We are advocates of open source software and open and transparent ways of working, which protects our customers, giving them freedom to choose their IT suppliers, and avoiding getting tied into a single vendor.

As a Cooperative we're guided by the seven cooperative principles in the way we run our business and live in our communities.
