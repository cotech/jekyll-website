Animorph makes software that enhances human potential.

We design, build, and support technological solutions to complex challenges spanning training, education, therapy, rehabilitation, and urban planning.

As a full service creative powerhouse we work from ideation and brief-crafting stages, into design and development, all the way through to deployment and maintenance. Specialising in extended reality, we have created virtual and augmented reality mobile apps, immersive websites, games and full stack systems.

Our company has a spotless record of delivering above expectation with our clients since 2016. We seek productive relationships with purpose-driven organisations, so reach out and letâ€™s forge alliances to make the future we want to live in.
