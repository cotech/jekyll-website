Agile Collective is a small team of designers and developers who make websites for socially positive organisations such as charities, NGOs, social enterprises and educational institutions. We take a highly creative and integrated approach to all of our projects which results in a transparent and empowering working environment for the whole project team – including our client.

As a socially minded company ourselves, we make every effort to contribute to our communities, minimise our environmental impact and ensure sustainability in our work practices. We organise the monthly Oxford Drupal Users Group and a couple of us run the ‘Code Club’ on a Wednesday afternoon which is aimed at inspiring young people to get into coding.

There is also a company-wide obsession with cycling of various kinds.
