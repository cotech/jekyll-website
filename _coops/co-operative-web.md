We are a 26 person worker co-operative based in Birmingham. Our focus is on development, rather than design or marketing stuff, and we work across all types of technology providing bespoke services by the hour, under retainers or for fixed price.

We specialise in building big data driven systems development and supporting both legacy and new applications for a range of clients, from large blue chip companies to small startups.
