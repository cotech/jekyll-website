**We are a design studio specialising in Branding, Design and Web Development.**

Creative Coop started life as a small group of freelancers who wanted to pool resources, collaborate together on web projects, and, ultimately, work towards a vision of a more sharing society. Our headquarters are in Colchester, Essex.

We chose to become a co-operative because we wanted to foster values of co-operation rather than competition between our members. We believe in the co-op vision of a fairer society run for mutual benefit rather than shareholder profit. We specialise in working with social enterprises, community projects and organisations, charities and the public sector.

We believe that co-operatives provide better products and services to clients. When we’re happy, and believe in what we’re doing, and when every member has a stake in the success of the company, we think that makes for happier clients too.
